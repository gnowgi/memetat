\section{The Proposed Model: A Dynamic Architecture}
\label{sec:model}

At the heart of our proposal is the \emph{Sensation-Modulating Network} (SMN), 
a framework for understanding the cognitive agent as an integrated whole rather than 
as a brain-centered processor. The SMN addresses central questions of cognitive science 
by specifying how agents construct geometric pictures of their world through 
\emph{action-based differentiation}. It is not conceived as a single organ but as the 
functional organization of the agent, defined by a set of core biological design principles. 
These principles—polarity, tubular topology, segmentation, bilateral symmetry, multi-zonal and antagonistic organization—
are ubiquitous across animal bodies, yet their implications 
for cognition have not been fully explored, though they are well recognized within biology.
\marginpar{The body-plan is dynamically coupled with the habitat and cannot be studied independently to describe or explain cognitive phenomena.}

All living agents generate rhythmic action patterns—oscillatory movements such as beating, 
swimming, walking, and breathing—that anchor them in time. Cognition, we argue, arises from 
the \emph{capacity to interrupt and reconfigure} such rhythmic patterns, and in that process the organism decodes the space by modulating sensations. This interruption 
creates a hierarchy of action patterns: 
\emph{Fixed Action Patterns} (FAPs), \emph{Haltable Action Patterns} (HAPs), and 
\emph{Transactional Action Patterns} (TAPs). 
This hierarchy makes possible both stability and flexibility in behavior, uniting automatized responses with adaptive control.

\marginpar{Interruptibility as a minimal cognitive act.}

\paragraph{Interruptibility operator.}\label{interrupt-operator}
Let $\Gamma$ be a \FAP{} limit cycle with phase $\theta(t)$.
Define the halt operator $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ which, when applied at time $t_0$, transiently perturbs control parameters so that
\[
\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}[\Gamma](t_0\!:\!t_0{+}\alpha):\quad \dot\theta(t)\approx 0
\]
moving the trajectory to a non-oscillatory set for duration $\alpha$. 
A \HAP{} is $(\Gamma,\mathcal{H}_\alpha)$; an \OAP{} is a finite sequence $\big(\mathcal{H}_{\alpha_k}\big)$ across modules/zones; a \TAP{} is any \HAP{}/\OAP{} that also writes a public trace readable by other agents.

The SMN is realized through the evolved architecture of the body plan: segmented, polarized, 
bilaterally symmetrical, and antagonistically organized. We shall first sketch the body plan in the following sections, followed by their cognitive role.
