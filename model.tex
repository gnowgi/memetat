\section{The Proposed Model: A Dynamic Architecture}
\label{sec:model}

At the heart of our proposal is the \emph{Sensation-Modulating Network} (SMN), 
a framework for understanding the cognitive agent as an integrated whole rather than 
as a brain-centered processor. The SMN addresses central questions of cognitive science 
by specifying how agents construct geometric pictures of their world through 
\emph{action-based differentiation}. It is not conceived as a single organ but as the 
functional organization of the agent, defined by a set of core biological design principles. 
These principles—polarity, tubular topology, segmentation, bilateral symmetry, multi-zonal and antagonistic organization—
are ubiquitous across animal bodies, yet their implications 
for cognition have not been fully explored, though they are well recognized within biology.
\marginpar{The body-plan is dynamically coupled with the habitat and cannot be studied independently to describe or explain cognitive phenomena.}
