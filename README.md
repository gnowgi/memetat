# A Dynamic Architecture of a Cognitive Agent

This repository contains the source files for the research paper, "A Dynamic Architecture of a Cognitive Agent."

## About the Paper

This paper presents a novel framework for cognitive science that aims to reconcile the long-standing divisions between cognitivist and 4E (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended) approaches. We propose a model of the cognitive agent based on a specific, yet generalizable, biological architecture we term the Sensation-Modulating Network (SMN).

Our central thesis is that core cognitive phenomena—including subjective experience, the construction of a meaningful world, and generative syntax—emerge not from pure computation, but from the agent's capacity to modulate its own action patterns within this architecture.
