  abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were               inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic,               statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal               theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from               those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches               have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed               to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A               perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context               of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual               experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up               patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a               top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate               sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage               and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of               perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual               experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic               representations of perceptual components are extracted from               experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of               green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become               organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that               produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g.,               simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for               aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of               proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g.,               compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these               simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents               types, supports categorization, and produces categorical               inferences. These simulators further support productivity,               propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully               functional conceptual system. Productivity results from               integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce               complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators               to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations.               Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined               physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of               knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system               while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems.               Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development,               and artificial intelligence are explored.},

Here we test the hypothesis that these                   features evolved in the context of making and using                   stone tools, specifically for producing large                   gripping forces and for countering large joint                   contact stresses. We used portable force plates                   simulating early stone tools to: 1) document and                   compare the magnitude of external/internal forces                   and joint stresses in the radial digits during                   hardhammer percussion and flake use, and 2) examine                   how variation in digit morphology affects muscle and                   joint mechanics during stone tool use. Force and                   kinematic data were collected from a sample                   representing normal variation in digit morphology                   (n = 25). The effects of digit size/shape on digit                   biomechanics were evaluated using partial                   correlations, controlling for tool reaction forces                   and impact velocities. Results show that individuals                   with longer digits require relatively less muscle                   force to stabilize digital joints, and are exposed                   to relatively lower joint contact stresses during                   stone tool use, due in part to an increase in the                   robusticity of metacarpals and phalanges in humans                   relative to chimpanzees. These analyses further                   suggest that Pan- or australopith-like pollical                   anatomy presents serious performance challenges to                   habitual tool use. Our data support the hypothesis                   that evolutionary increases in thumb length,                   robusticity, and thenar muscle mass enabled Homo to                   produce more force and to tolerate higher joint                   stresses during tool use.}

When intelligence is approached in an                incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the                real world through perception and action, reliance on                representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach                to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The                fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into                independent information processing units which must interface                with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent                system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity                producers which all interface directly to the world through                perception and action, rather than interface to each other                particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems                evaporate---everything is both central and peripheral. Based on                these principles we have built a very successful series of                mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in                standard office environments.},

As relations, affordances are both                real and perceivable but are not properties of either the                environment or the animal. I argue that this theory has                advantages over extant theories of affordances and briefly                discuss the relations among affordances and niches, perceivers,                and events.}

Withholding action forms the basis of self-control, delayed gratification, social contracts, and trust in others. Most experimental studies of this function come from studying the processing of external stop signals. However, another important aspect of inhibition is ‘will-power’, i.e., intentional inhibitory control over one's own actions, in the absence of external countermanding signals. We review whether a concept of intentional inhibition is justified, and how it might differ from externally triggered inhibition. Further, we consider three types of neuroscientific evidence that can clarify the brain's mechanisms of inhibition: neuropsychology, neurostimulation and neuroimaging. Finally, we propose a model in which intentional inhibition, unlike externally triggered inhibition, is linked to representing longer range consequences of action decisions. We suggest that the human brain contains a ‘neural brake’ mechanism that blocks specific ongoing motor activity, and that this mechanism plays a key role in action decisions.}

The framework of this approach is centered on a core                set of ideas, such as autonomy, sense-making, emergence,                embodiment, and experience. These concepts are finding novel                applications in a diverse range of areas. One hot topic has been                the establishment of an enactive approach to social interaction.                The main purpose of this paper is to serve as an advanced entry                point into these recent developments. It accomplishes this task                in a twofold manner: (i) it provides a succinct synthesis of the                most important core ideas and arguments in the theoretical                framework of the enactive approach, and (ii) it uses this                synthesis to refine the current enactive approach to social                interaction. A new operational definition of social interaction                is proposed which not only emphasizes the cognitive agency of                the individuals and the irreducibility of the interaction                process itself, but also the need for jointly co-regulated                action. It is suggested that this revised conception of                `socio-cognitive interaction' may provide the necessary middle                ground from which to understand the confluence of biological and                cultural values in personal action.},

These arguments are followed                by a review of approaches to embodiment, including those from                cognitive linguistics, perceptual symbol theory, and                action-based theories.

  abstract = {Cognitive science normally takes the individual agent as its                unit of analysis. In many human endeavors, however, the outcomes                of interest are not determined entirely by the information                processing properties of individuals. Nor can they be inferred                from the properties of the individual agents, alone, no matter                how detailed the knowledge of the properties of those                individuals may be. In commercial aviation, for example, the                successful completion of a flight is produced by a system that                typically includes two or more pilots interacting with each                other and with a suite of technological devices. This article                presents a theoretical framework that takes a distributed,                socio-technical system rather than an individual mind as its                primary unit of analysis. This framework is explicitly cognitive                in that it is concerned with how information is represented and                how representations are transformed and propagated in the                performance of tasks. An analysis of a memory task in the                cockpit of a commercial airliner shows how the cognitive                properties of such distributed systems can differ radically from                the cognitive properties of the individuals who inhabit them.},

To this extent, extensive practice is associated with the development of general and task-specific mental representations, which play an important role in the organization and control of action. Recently, new experimental methods have been developed, which allow for investigating the organization and structure of these representations, along with the functional structure of the movement kinematics. In the current article, we present a new approach for examining the overlap between skill representations and motor output. In doing so, we first present an architecture model, which addresses links between biomechanical and cognitive levels of motor control. Next, we review the state of the art in assessing memory structures underlying complex action. Following we present a new spatio-temporal decomposition method for illuminating the functional structure of movement kinematics, and finally, we apply these methods to investigate the overlap between the structure of motor representations in memory and their corresponding kinematic structures. Our aim is to understand the extent to which the output at a kinematic level is governed by representations at a cognitive level of motor control.</p>}

Patterns of evolutionary changes in symmetry types and the homology of body axes across lineages are discussed here by confronting evidence from comparative anatomy, phylogeny, genomics and evo-devo. The conventional scenario, postulating a graded complexification from asymmetry to radial and finally bilateral symmetry, is considered untenable. Cylindrical symmetry is likely to be the ancestral type from which derived all remaining types through multiple convergences. Recent proposals prompted by molecular data that the bilateral anatomies of many cnidarians and of the Bilateria are homologous are clearly not supported. The Hox-based patterning system operating along the antero-posterior axis of the Bilateria does not seem to predate their divergence with the Cnidaria, but intercellular signalling systems, notably the Wnt pathway, could have been involved in generating the main body axis in the last common ancestor of the Metazoa.

  abstract = {In an attempt of fractionating the concept of intentionality in discrete subcomponents, Brass and Haggard (2008) proposed their What, When and Whether model (www-model) which postulates that the content, the timing and the possibility of generating an action can be partially independent both at the cognitive level and at the level of their neural implementation. The original proposal was based on a limited number of studies, which were reviewed with a discursive approach. To assess whether the model stands in front of the more recently published data, we performed a systematic review of 15 PET/fMRI studies with a meta-analytic method based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm. HC revealed the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient within the medial prefrontal cortex, with the more anterior regions (the anterior cingulum) involved in more abstract decisions of whether to execute an action and the more posterior ones (the middle cingulum or the SMA) recruited in specifying the content and the timing components of actions.  However, in contrast with the original www-model, this dissociation involves also brain regions well outside the median wall of the frontal lobe, in a component specific manner: the supramarginal gyrus for the what component, the pallidum and the thalamus for the when component, the putamen and the insula for the whether component. We then calculated co-activation maps on the three component-specific www clusters of the medial wall of the frontal/limbic lobe: to this end, we used the activation likelihood approach that we applied on the imaging studies on action contained in the BrainMap.org database. This analysis confirmed the main findings of the HC analyses. However, the BrainMap.org data analyses also showed that the aforementioned segregations are generated by paradigms in which subjects act in response to conditional stimuli rather than while driven by their own intentions. We conclude that the available data confirm that the neural underpinnings of intentionality can be fractionated in discrete components that are partially independent. We also suggest that intentionality manifests itself in discrete components through the boosting of general purpose action-related regions specialized for different aspects of action selection and inhibition.}

  abstract = {In addition to being one of the greatest technical philosophers                of the twentieth century, John Dewey (1859-1952) was an                educational innovator, a Progressive Era reformer, and one of                America's last great public intellectuals. Dewey's insights into                the problems of public education, immigration, the prospects for                democratic government, and the relation of religious faith to                science are as fresh today as when they were first published.                His penetrating treatments of the nature and function of                philosophy, the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life, and                the role of inquiry in human experience are of increasing                relevance at the turn of the 21st century. Based on the                award-winning 37-volume critical edition of Dewey's work, The                Essential Dewey presents for the first time a collection of                Dewey's writings that is both manageable and comprehensive. The                volume includes essays and book chapters that exhibit Dewey's                intellectual development over time; the selection represents his                mature thinking on every major issue to which he turned his                attention. Eleven part divisions cover: Dewey in Context;                Reconstructing Philosophy; Evolutionary Naturalism; Pragmatic                Metaphysics; Habit, Conduct, and Language; Meaning, Truth, and                Inquiry; Valuation and Ethics; The Aims of Education; The                Individual, the Community, and Democracy; Pragmatism and                Culture: Science and Technology, Art and Religion; and                Interpretations and Critiques. Taken as a whole, this collection                provides unique access to Dewey's understanding of the problems                and prospects of human existence and of the philosophical                enterprise.},

  title = {Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought},
  year = {2004},
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  isbn = {9780262572194},
  abstract = {Within cognitive science, two approaches currently dominate the                problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views                cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation.                Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models                associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter                G{\"a}rdenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations                as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist                approaches.Symbolic representation is particularly weak at                modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding                many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to                the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the                symbolic approach. G{\"a}rdenfors's theory of conceptual spaces                presents a framework for representing information on the                conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from                geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions.                The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side                of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be                applied to the development of artificial systems capable of                solving cognitive tasks. G{\"a}rdenfors also shows how                conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a                number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning                concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to                present a coherent research program that can be used as a basis                for more detailed investigations.},

  abstract = {This book presents an argument that perception is something we                do, not something that happens to us: not a process in the                brain, but a skillful bodily activity. Perception is not                something that happens to us, or in us, writes Alva Noe. It is                something we do. In Action in Perception, Noe argues that                perception and perceptual consciousness depend on capacities for                action and thought - that perception is a kind of thoughtful                activity. Touch, not vision, should be our model for perception.                Perception is not a process in the brain, but a kind of skilful                activity of the body as a whole. We enact our perceptual                experience. To perceive, according to this enactive approach to                perception, is not merely to have sensations; it is to have                sensations that we understand. In Action in Perception, Noe                investigates the forms this understanding can take. He begins by                arguing, on both phenomenological and empirical grounds, that                the content of perception is not like the content of a picture;                the world is not given to consciousness all at once but is                gained gradually by active inquiry and exploration. possession                and exercise of practical bodily knowledge, and examines, among                other topics, the problems posed by spatial content and the                experience of colour. He considers the perspectival aspect of                the representational content of experience and assesses the                place of thought and understanding in experience. Finally, he                explores the implications of the enactive approach for our                understanding of the neuroscience of perception.},

By providing an overview of his ``synthetic                neurorobotics'' project, Tani reveals how symbols and concepts                that represent the world can emerge in a neurodynamic                structure--iterative interactions between the top-down                subjective view, which proactively acts on the world, and the                bottom-up recognition of the resultant perceptual reality. He                argues that nontrivial problems of consciousness and free will                could be addressed through structural understanding of such                iterative, conflicting interactions between the top-down and the                bottom-up pathways. A wide range of readers will enjoy this                wonderful journey of the mind and will follow the author on                interdisciplinary discussions that span neuroscience, dynamical                systems theories, robotics, and phenomenology.

Yet this landmark volume is essential reading for all of them.''                -- Annette Karmiloff-Smith and Mark H. Johnson, ``Nature'' A                Dynamic Systems Approach to the Development of Cognition and                Action presents a comprehensive and detailed theory of early                human development based on the principles of dynamic systems                theory. Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual,                and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental                questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They                propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action,                unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current                research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular,                they show how by processes of exploration and selection,                multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing                perception-action categories. Thelen and Smith offer a radical                alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis                on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of                change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to                psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic                issues in early cognitive development. The book is divided into                three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental                processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles                in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic                theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.

  abstract = {The most basic property of human language is that                   in each of its variants, it provides an unbounded                   array of hierarchically structured expressions that                   receive interpretations at two interfaces,                   sensorymotor for externalization and                   conceptual-intentional for mental processes. A                   central problem, then, is to determine the nature of                   the recursive procedures that have this                   property. General scientific norms direct inquiry to                   the simplest possible solution – minimal recursion –                   to deepen explanatory power and expedite the study                   of language acquisition, and to offer some hope for                   some eventual insight into evolution of the language                   capacity. Pursuit of this objective has led to                   elimination of many unwanted stipulations and also                   grounding some fundamental properties of universal                   grammar. Among other consequences, it provides                   evidence for an asymmetry of the interfaces, with                   externalization an ancillary procedure, a conclusion                   consistent with well-known properties of language                   and the very limited evidence about evolution.},

A                failure to take into account the complex iconic and indexical                infrastructure of symbolic interpretation processes has blocked                progress in the study of language structure, language evolution,                neural processing of language, and language acquisition.                Simplistic notions of symbolic interpretation are critiqued, the                semiotic infrastructure of symbolic interpretive processes is                described, and some implication for understanding the universals                of grammar and syntax are explored. Finally, the evolutionary                problem of language origins is re-examined and an unexpected                important role for relaxation of selection is demonstrated.}
