  abstract = {The most basic property of human language is that
                  in each of its variants, it provides an unbounded
                  array of hierarchically structured expressions that
                  receive interpretations at two interfaces,
                  sensorymotor for externalization and
                  conceptual-intentional for mental processes. A
                  central problem, then, is to determine the nature of
                  the recursive procedures that have this
                  property. General scientific norms direct inquiry to
                  the simplest possible solution – minimal recursion –
                  to deepen explanatory power and expedite the study
                  of language acquisition, and to offer some hope for
                  some eventual insight into evolution of the language
                  capacity. Pursuit of this objective has led to
                  elimination of many unwanted stipulations and also
                  grounding some fundamental properties of universal
                  grammar. Among other consequences, it provides
                  evidence for an asymmetry of the interfaces, with
                  externalization an ancillary procedure, a conclusion
                  consistent with well-known properties of language
                  and the very limited evidence about evolution.},

                  apes, with long robust thumbs, relatively larger
                  joint surfaces, and hypertrophic thenar
                  muscles. Here we test the hypothesis that these
                  features evolved in the context of making and using
                  stone tools, specifically for producing large
                  gripping forces and for countering large joint
                  contact stresses. We used portable force plates
                  simulating early stone tools to: 1) document and
                  compare the magnitude of external/internal forces
                  and joint stresses in the radial digits during
                  hardhammer percussion and flake use, and 2) examine
                  how variation in digit morphology affects muscle and
                  joint mechanics during stone tool use. Force and
                  kinematic data were collected from a sample
                  representing normal variation in digit morphology
                  (n = 25). The effects of digit size/shape on digit
                  biomechanics were evaluated using partial
                  correlations, controlling for tool reaction forces
                  and impact velocities. Results show that individuals
                  with longer digits require relatively less muscle
                  force to stabilize digital joints, and are exposed
                  to relatively lower joint contact stresses during
                  stone tool use, due in part to an increase in the
                  robusticity of metacarpals and phalanges in humans
                  relative to chimpanzees. These analyses further
                  suggest that Pan- or australopith-like pollical
                  anatomy presents serious performance challenges to
                  habitual tool use. Our data support the hypothesis
                  that evolutionary increases in thumb length,
                  robusticity, and thenar muscle mass enabled Homo to
                  produce more force and to tolerate higher joint
                  stresses during tool use.}

@ARTICLE{Barsalou1999-wt,
  title    = "Perceptual symbol systems",
  author   = "Barsalou, L W",
  abstract = "Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were
              inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic,
              statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal
              theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from
              those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches
              have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed
              to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A
              perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context
              of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual
              experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up
              patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a
              top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate
              sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage
              and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of
              perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual
              experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic
              representations of perceptual components are extracted from
              experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of
              green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become
              organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that
              produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g.,
              simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for
              aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of
              proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g.,
              compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these
              simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents
              types, supports categorization, and produces categorical
              inferences. These simulators further support productivity,
              propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully
              functional conceptual system. Productivity results from
              integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce
              complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators
              to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations.
              Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined
              physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of
              knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system
              while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems.

               of the twentieth century, John Dewey (1859-1952) was an
               educational innovator, a Progressive Era reformer, and one of
               America's last great public intellectuals. Dewey's insights into
               the problems of public education, immigration, the prospects for
               democratic government, and the relation of religious faith to
               science are as fresh today as when they were first published.
               His penetrating treatments of the nature and function of
               philosophy, the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life, and
               the role of inquiry in human experience are of increasing
               relevance at the turn of the 21st century. Based on the
               award-winning 37-volume critical edition of Dewey's work, The
               Essential Dewey presents for the first time a collection of
               Dewey's writings that is both manageable and comprehensive. The
               volume includes essays and book chapters that exhibit Dewey's
               intellectual development over time; the selection represents his
               mature thinking on every major issue to which he turned his
               attention. Eleven part divisions cover: Dewey in Context;
               Reconstructing Philosophy; Evolutionary Naturalism; Pragmatic
               Metaphysics; Habit, Conduct, and Language; Meaning, Truth, and

               Culture: Science and Technology, Art and Religion; and
               Interpretations and Critiques. Taken as a whole, this collection

               answer an essential and tantalizing question: How do our minds
               work? By providing an overview of his ``synthetic
               neurorobotics'' project, Tani reveals how symbols and concepts
               that represent the world can emerge in a neurodynamic
               structure--iterative interactions between the top-down
               subjective view, which proactively acts on the world, and the
               bottom-up recognition of the resultant perceptual reality. He
               argues that nontrivial problems of consciousness and free will
               could be addressed through structural understanding of such
               iterative, conflicting interactions between the top-down and the
               bottom-up pathways. A wide range of readers will enjoy this
               wonderful journey of the mind and will follow the author on
               interdisciplinary discussions that span neuroscience, dynamical
               systems theories, robotics, and phenomenology. The book also

               Dynamic Systems Approach to the Development of Cognition and
               Action presents a comprehensive and detailed theory of early
               human development based on the principles of dynamic systems
               theory. Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual,
               and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental
               questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They
               propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action,
               unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current
               research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular,
               they show how by processes of exploration and selection,
               multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing
               perception-action categories. Thelen and Smith offer a radical
               alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis
               on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of
               change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to
               psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic
               issues in early cognitive development. The book is divided into
               three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental
               processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles
               in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic
               theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.

  abstract  = "Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of
               representation. When intelligence is approached in an
               incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the
               real world through perception and action, reliance on
               representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach
               to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The
               fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into
               independent information processing units which must interface
               with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent
               system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity
               producers which all interface directly to the world through
               perception and action, rather than interface to each other
               particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems
               evaporate---everything is both central and peripheral. Based on
               these principles we have built a very successful series of

               do, not something that happens to us: not a process in the
               brain, but a skillful bodily activity. Perception is not
               something that happens to us, or in us, writes Alva Noe. It is
               something we do. In Action in Perception, Noe argues that
               perception and perceptual consciousness depend on capacities for
               action and thought - that perception is a kind of thoughtful
               activity. Touch, not vision, should be our model for perception.
               Perception is not a process in the brain, but a kind of skilful
               activity of the body as a whole. We enact our perceptual
               experience. To perceive, according to this enactive approach to
               perception, is not merely to have sensations; it is to have
               sensations that we understand. In Action in Perception, Noe
               investigates the forms this understanding can take. He begins by
               arguing, on both phenomenological and empirical grounds, that
               the content of perception is not like the content of a picture;
               the world is not given to consciousness all at once but is
               gained gradually by active inquiry and exploration. possession

               other topics, the problems posed by spatial content and the
               experience of colour. He considers the perspectival aspect of
               the representational content of experience and assesses the
               place of thought and understanding in experience. Finally, he
               explores the implications of the enactive approach for our

               spectrum of disciplines which are united in rejecting the still
               dominant computationalist paradigm in favor of the enactive
               approach. The framework of this approach is centered on a core
               set of ideas, such as autonomy, sense-making, emergence,
               embodiment, and experience. These concepts are finding novel
               applications in a diverse range of areas. One hot topic has been
               the establishment of an enactive approach to social interaction.
               The main purpose of this paper is to serve as an advanced entry
               point into these recent developments. It accomplishes this task
               in a twofold manner: (i) it provides a succinct synthesis of the
               most important core ideas and arguments in the theoretical
               framework of the enactive approach, and (ii) it uses this
               synthesis to refine the current enactive approach to social
               interaction. A new operational definition of social interaction
               is proposed which not only emphasizes the cognitive agency of
               the individuals and the irreducibility of the interaction
               process itself, but also the need for jointly co-regulated
               action. It is suggested that this revised conception of
               `socio-cognitive interaction' may provide the necessary middle
               ground from which to understand the confluence of biological and

  abstract  = "Cognitive science normally takes the individual agent as its
               unit of analysis. In many human endeavors, however, the outcomes
               of interest are not determined entirely by the information
               processing properties of individuals. Nor can they be inferred
               from the properties of the individual agents, alone, no matter
               how detailed the knowledge of the properties of those
               individuals may be. In commercial aviation, for example, the
               successful completion of a flight is produced by a system that
               typically includes two or more pilots interacting with each
               other and with a suite of technological devices. This article
               presents a theoretical framework that takes a distributed,
               socio-technical system rather than an individual mind as its
               primary unit of analysis. This framework is explicitly cognitive
               in that it is concerned with how information is represented and
               how representations are transformed and propagated in the
               performance of tasks. An analysis of a memory task in the
               cockpit of a commercial airliner shows how the cognitive
               properties of such distributed systems can differ radically from

               problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views
               cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation.
               Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models
               associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter
               G{\"a}rdenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations
               as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist
               approaches.Symbolic representation is particularly weak at
               modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding
               many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to
               the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the
               symbolic approach. G{\"a}rdenfors's theory of conceptual spaces
               presents a framework for representing information on the
               conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from
               geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions.
               The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side
               of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be
               applied to the development of artificial systems capable of
               solving cognitive tasks. G{\"a}rdenfors also shows how
               conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a
               number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning
               concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to
