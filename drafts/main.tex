\noindent \textbf{Long Title:} \textit{A Segmented, Polarized, Bilaterally Symmetrical, Antagonistically Organized Multizonal Coordinated Pairs in the form of a Layered Sensation Modulating Network Implementing Fixed, Haltable and Transactional Action Patterns of Conscious Semiotic Agents}


\begin{abstract}
\noindent \textbf{Abstract:} 


We propose that the core problem of cognitive science is to find an answer to the following questions: (1) What structures and dynamics do we need \textit{in} the agent such that phenomenological experience is possible --- addressing head-on the so-called hard problem of consciousness? (2) How does a cognitive agent construct a geometric picture of an external and internal world, and (3) how can the generated picture be meaningfully shared with other agents?  The proposal is presented as a set of grounded hypotheses that form a coherent framework reconciling the apparently opposing positions in cognitive science. (1) An autonomous cognitive agent is biologically grounded in a sensation-modulating-network (SMN) of multiple actions zones, which are anatomically and functionally situated in a polarized, antagonistic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented topological tube --- the body; (2) From a cognitive point of view, a nervous system is needed not to initiate or regulate the movement of muscles, contra received view, but for halting the dynamical action patterns within the limits of multiple attractors of dynamical systems, called action zones, provisioning the freedom to deviate a fixed action pattern enabling phenomenological experience and exploration of the world; (3) A multiple pairs of antagonistically coordinated action zones connected through a neuronal network evolve a variational sequence of action patterns through exaptation due to affordances offered by the external world, and constrained by the anatomical and functional limitations of the internal world of the body; (4) Initial action patterns are saturated by objects facilitating the creation of saturated internal models of objects, which when performed without an object generates unsaturated internal models of an object, entering representational semiotic world; (5) The possibility of variable sequential multi-zonal dialogical haltable action patterns introduces gaps facilitating generative syntax among the action patterns and their traces both within and outside the body; (6) All the above mechanisms are implemented in a physical and physiological sensation modulating network, the body, making phenomenological experience not an oddity but an essence; (7) Modulatable sensory motor action patterns provide all essential variables to compute the geometry of the body as well as location of objects and events of the world through a robust criteria of presence and absence of reflective feedback loops, where muscles play the role of location sensors facilitating the construction of the core variables that construct a meaningful world --- space and time; (8) The saturated/situated multi-zonal dialogical recursive archestration of HAPs supports engineering through tool use, extending the field of affordances; (9) The unsaturated disengaged multi-zonal dialogical recursive archestratiions of HAPs, become the basis for creating arbitrary transactional action patterns (TAPs) enabling propositional traces and other symbolic and cultural practices; and (10) finally how the above foundation offers a rich enough context for rule based rigorous construction of unambiguous microworlds, generating proportional and procedural knowledge through model based reasoning and experimental investigations --- provisioning as roots for STEM practices. We conclude by revisiting the stated objectives and how they can be met by offering a reinterpretation of various scientific studies supporting the above-stated principles.

One might ask: What is the identified gap this monograph is addressing? We make a broad assumption that the two major camps in cognitive science, cognitivism, and 4E cognition, both believe (1) in the biological basis of a life full of rules and representations, (2) both follow the scientific method in their investigations, (3) both believe that human evolution is part of the same thread of organic evolution, and (4) both of them refer to neurobiology to locate their roots.  And yet they have strong disagreements on whether representations are apparent or real, 

The following section elaborates an architecture of a cognitive agent's body. The next section is about construction of the problem-space. And in the latter section we perform a model based reasoning to demonstrate how concept formation, generative syntax, semantics, transient and in-transient memories and cultural tenets of gamified human-being are possible. Simultaneously, we provide clear indications on empirically grounding the model. However, a detailed treatment of interpreting established experimental findings deserves more space, which will be out of the scope of the paper.

\section{Model Based Reasoning}\label{mbr}

\section{Discussion} \label{discussion}

Inter-subjectivity, shared memory space, shared experiences. This is possible because, relations are mathematical and not based on material objects. Matter does not matter in inter-subjectivity.

Connecting with the current dominant acceptable positions: forward model, Friston free energy, predictive models of cognition and memory.

The principle of charity - Davidson.
The principle of benefit of doubt. Putnam--Davidson--Rorty

-----
- Accounting for shared memory and shared experience: Possibility of inter-subjective space niche construction, where people can negotiate.
----
- Affinities and differences (mimetics also Dennett, the Hard problem of consciousness- Chalmers)

Grounding Politics: Before we move to the next section, it is important to underline that encoding action-patterns and decoding action-patterns are asymmetrical. The possibility to separate encoding from decoding is the reason for exploitation in the politics of code.

\section{Grounding Semiotics}

The model is in contrast to this brain-body-world schema that is so popularly described by almost all the current schools in cognitive science, even among opposing camps of cognitivism and 4E cognition. Though cognitivism goes with the brain-body-world schema, among the 4E cognition camp is divided between brain-body-world and body-world schemas. For example Ponty, Noe, Brooks, Thelen & Smith, van Gelder, (look for representative citations in neuro-centricity).


The theoretical frameworks in the current cognitive science are broadly grouped into opposing camps of cognitivism (e.g. Simon & Newell, Miller, Chomsky, Fodor, Pylyshyn, Pinker, Tolman) and 4E models (e.g. Menary, Ponty, Gibson, Maturana, Varela, Lakoff & Johnson, Noe, Barsalou, Glenberg, Vygotksy, Lave, Hutchins, Clarke, Thelen & Smith, van Gelder, Brooks, Chemero, Shapiro, Deacon, Wheeler, Hutto, Froese, Damasio, Gardenfors, Tani). Many nueroscientists and others like Dennett, Pierce, Bordeaux, Chalmers, 

Ratio processing is more primitive than the number sense.\cite{matthews2015fractions} x parts/portion of y. Integers are relational. God created relations not integers (a remark on Kronecker and Stephen Hawking). Relations are more more primitive because counting depends on the availability of relations: one of two, three of two, one among others etc. At best they are two sides of the same coin. 
-----
The ambiguity of reference, in this case, will become clearer once we understand the difficulty of another person who does not know whether you are talking about the action pattern or the cup. A similar problem of ostension was discussed by Wittgenstein, calling them as ostensive definitions. How to reduce the ambiguity from this context? We argue that this ambiguity cannot be eliminated, unless the cup and the holding action-pattern can be seen independent of each other. The miming action pattern of holding a cup without a cup makes an action pattern referring to an object possible.


We agree with the schools of thought within cognitive science on some aspects and disagree and explore other alternative forms of explanation. Here, we provide a brief comparison of the major research programs.

\subsection{With cognitive-neuroscience}
The empirical findings of cognitive neuroscience cannot be disputed, because they are rigorously  conducted experiments. Their interpretation is valid, given their assumptions. Based on the model presented here we shall reinterpret their results, and motivate new experimental designs.  We do not agree brain as a coordinating point of action or a storehouse of memories, but enables them to store within the body and coordinate action by the body. We consider cognitive features as systemic properties of the entire LSMN, and of any localized part. 
\subsection{With generative grammar}
The core faculty of language is genetic (biologically granted) which evolved through organic evolution.  We agree with the view that human language develops from a predominant recursively generatable machine that can generate infinite combinations\cite{chomsky}.  We also consider that any theory that cannot account for this `fact' will not be considered worthy candidate.  We attempt to demostrate how the proposed model would ground generative grammar in the body reinforced by the social habits.
\subsection{With 4E-Cognition?}
Cognition is predominantly an action and takes time and effort to execute. Affordances of a cognitive agent provide meaning, and an inter-subjective space to share between agents. We also agree that much of human memories are externalized in multiple spaces outside the body. But we do not agree with the radical versions of 4E that human cognition can be explained without \textit{internal} representations. We have  memories \textit{stored} within the body that can be replayed.

One common argument that we often read in the literature on embodied cognition is that most of human cognition, including language, can be without \textit{internal} representations.\cite{linguistic_bodies}

\subsection{With Cognitive Robotics, AI and Machine Learning} 
Unlike the old-school AI, which is based on the model of an expert system (and a thorough information processing model), the recent breakthroughs in machine learning use neural networks. Cognitive robotics demonstrated that robots build a model of the environment with lesser dependence on internal databases. Data is built and used from the context (environment) while learning. These are more autonomous than any machines that were built in the past, indicating that this can be one of the confirming test-beds for cognitive theories. The model we propose is a synthesis of the idea that a layered mathematical computing machine can learn, and sensory sub-systems when mounted on proprioceptic motor components, which in turn are connected deferentially to the underlying computing network can develop habits in a habitat.  

\subsection{With Dynamical Systems}


\subsection{Novel Proposals}
\textbf{LSMN thesis}: The body is modeled as a sensory-motor-network. Nervous system provides layered network with the sensory-motor zones of the body. We do not model
the interaction schematic as brain-body-environment, with brain at the center. Instead it is body-environment, where the body is a layered network of sensory-motor sub-systems. 

The role of brain is to connect. By this, we are not undermining its role, but enhancing it. Connections can create emergent patterns, and connections can compute. Connected body can provide unitary experience. Connections can introduce delay in propagation, differential connections can generate variety. Cognition is an effect of the netework. 

Layered architecture creates an internal world, making reflexive actions possible. A part of the body can act with another part.  

\textbf{rHAPS thesis}: Motor control is obtained by haltability of motor action. This requires gaps in connections in an otherwise connected machine.  

The action patterns, which the SMN (the body) can’t afford to halt forming the inner layers of the network, are called beats. Beats are physiologically unaffordable for disengagement (e.g. heartbeats). The action patterns that can halt, generating variable patterns, are called haltable action patterns (HAPs) (e.g. breathing, walking, dancing, singing, talking etc). We argue that syntactic symbolic processing is impossible without variable haltability. Haltability is a ‘physiologically affordable anatomical disengagement’ (symbol ungrounding), which provides for a choice of actions. In our model, we argue that the genesis of syntax and freedom of choice are co-evolving features.
An orchestrated, variable, iterable and recursive set of action patterns become possible because of multiple zones of action patterns in the body (SMN). Here we argue that recursive action patterns make not only symbolic life possible but also tool use. Haltability itself provides recognisable reproducible variable experiences within an SMN generating meaning and memory. As an action-based ontological perspective, we not only support the view that the memory is for action (Glenberg), but also claim that reproducible action patterns ‘are’ memory, which is distributed in the SMN. 


\textbf{Computability thesis}: Only patterns can be computed. Patterns are relational configurations. By computing differentiation of differences we can obtain invariant results.  Similar or same results can be obtained from different inputs. This can be used as a logic of abstraction. 

(brought from the beats section) [Logically speaking, any data storage device requires a surface on which we can store (encode) the data. The surface can't be without a format. Analogically, the discs that we use in computers can't store data unless they are formatted using a file system. However, the file allocation table in a biological system emerges dynamically. Though we use this analogy to ascribe the role played by the beats in cognition, the differences between the architecture of a computing system that we are proposing is radically different from the von Newmann architecture.]





\section{Falsification criteria}
 Biological falsification criteria
 Cognitive Robotics based criteria: The robots themselves will be made in a layered manner. (Brooks kind of model, where there is no prior data, only of action patterns; behaviour is dependent on the environment, and data will be generated through interactions)
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item We predict there is always some or other activity (eye saccades, dampened motor activity) while simulating, say like in forward models. This is a falsifiability criterion.
     \item
 \end{itemize}
 
%\clearpage
Topology contrast to be elaborated.

Recurrence is like rumination helping in assimilation and accommodation.

Cognition is a geometrical (GPS) processing problem. geometry of thought (\cite{Gardenfors2004-pi})

GPS needs a clock. Multiple signals, and a processor that maps the delay to distance. 

- which location the time has come
- we need multiple such locations where the time stamp comes
- 2nd law: greater the relative delay, greater the distance. 
- order of the world; patterns of the world; 
- HAPs are serial.
- HAPs give us naming the world
- arbitrary HAPs (disengaged) give us a arbitrary mapping; human languages.

- saturation and desaturation; 
- completely desaturated world is resolved only in terms of geometry
- saturated world comes in different shades; 



HAPS help the cognitive agent to generate relative geometry of the body.  


Sensory subsystem: signal generation, data production

motor subsystem: geometrical processing unit that constructs the space/world 

communication subsystem: multizonal connections and disconnections 


1 haps are grounded in faps. one fap zone 
2 there are multiple faps organized in antagonistic way
3 the antagonism is both mechanical and communication links

1. SMN resolves the relative location of the sensors/ transducers by self-modulation.

2. Self modulation changes the geometry of the SMN, the relative position of the sensors/transducers.

3. The resolution of internal and external world requires self-modulation and modulating the external world (which includes other self-modulating agents and inanimate world.)

4. The internal world is innate. Phylogeny and ontogeny provides the internal geometry.

5. External geometry (world) is created by using the principal of non-reflexive modulation. 

6. The major assumption of constructing a cognitive agent is that reflexivity is possible due to the network architecture of multiple sensory zones.

7. Another major assumption is that all the nodes of the network are in the same timezone.

8. Location of each sensor is resolved by applying the principle of the mapping between the delay and distance.

9. Modulation is change in distance between the sensors.

10. HAPs help in the modulation (9).

11. The change in network changes the geometry and modulation possibilities. Learning here is essentially change in geometry.

12. Newer forms of modulation (new HAPs) is learning. So, there is internal and external world are constructed by this process.

Movved from introduction section:

We do this by proposing a problem space where other models can be executed. The problem space is defined by postulating that the animate nature of cognitive agent's body is due to a \textit{muscular system}, whose role is to compute relative \textit{location} of phenomena (geometry), and a \textit{nervous system} whose role is to differentiate and integrate sensory data stream based on \textit{temporal} order (dynamics). In other words, it is a problem of constructing coordinates of a space-time and locating phenomena in that space-time. The cognitive body is a Geographical Positioning System (GPS) which has a clock relative to a timezone, and an algorithm to calculate the relative positions of the source of sensations. The source of sensations our model are both within the body as well as the external environment. Therefore, the problem-space is identified both in the body as well as at the body-environment interface. The multi-modal map resulting from this computation is the cognitive (phenomenological and epistemic) world. All cognition related problems shall be addressed in this space. 

Given this modified view of the body and its role in constructing the problem space, we attempt the reconciliation between cognitivism and enactivism. We agree with cognitivists that representations are at the core of cognition, and we also agree with enactivists that cognition is an enactive process. The problem-space described above can accommodate both actions and representations. We do this by stating that action \textit{patterns} are the units of cognitive processes, and not actions per se. And all action patterns are embodied. However, we present a distinct spectrum of multi-modal embodiment described in terms of degrees of saturation. The saturation reduces by progressively disengaging one modality from the other by modulation --- the process of abstraction. The action patterns \textit{appear} as disengaged and disembodied representations or concepts. Thus action patterns are real, while representations are nothing but manifestations of action patterns and their traces. In other words, perceptions and conceptions are located within the problem-space, which is resolved as a multi-dimensional spectrum of decreasing saturation. Therefore, philosophically, we meet Quine's challenge in 'The two dogmas of empiricism', naturalizing epistemology.


Research programs in cognitive science must address the established problems of symbol grounding, the frame problem, awareness, memory, subjectivity, the possibility of objective knowledge, generative grammar, mathematics, and various cultural practices. However, we cannot find them addressed in a single reductionist theory. However, a confluence of a finite set of coherent models supported by empirical and experimental evidence could address them. It is with this optimism we attempt to present this proposal.
