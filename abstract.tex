\subsection*{Abstract}
This paper addresses the long-standing impasse between cognitivist and enactive approaches by proposing a new foundational model for cognitive science. We argue that this division stems from an incomplete understanding of the agent's biological architecture. To resolve this, we introduce the Sensation-Modulating Network (SMN), a model of the whole agent grounded in a specific set of general biological principles: a segmented, polarized, bilaterally symmetrical, and antagonistically organized body plan. Our central thesis is that cognition is not computation but action-modulation. We demonstrate how the capacity to halt ongoing, rhythmic action patterns—giving rise to a hierarchy of Fixed, Haltable, and Transactional Action Patterns (FAPs, HAPs, and TAPs)—is the fundamental cognitive act. This framework explains the emergence of phenomenological experience, the grounding of symbols via "unsaturated" actions, and the origins of generative syntax from the body's own combinatorial structure. By redefining cognition in this way, the SMN provides a unified, biologically-grounded account of consciousness, semiotics, and language.
